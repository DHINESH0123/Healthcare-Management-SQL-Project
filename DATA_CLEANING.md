# DATA CLEANING PROCESS

Data cleaning was performed using Microsoft Excel before importing the data
into Oracle Database.

Steps followed:
- Identified and removed null values
- Removed duplicate rows
- Checked data consistency across all tables
- Standardized date formats
- Exported cleaned data as CSV files

This ensured accurate and reliable SQL analysis.
